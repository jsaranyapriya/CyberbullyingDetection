# CyberbullyingDetection
The main objective of this project is to create a powerful method for detecting cyberbullying and abusive messages by utilizing term frequency- inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to examine different machine learning techniques and achieving high accuracy.

Dataset:
    Tweets Dataset for Detection of Cyber-Trolls obtained from DataTurks
    Data Cleaning, Preprocessing (Word Tokenization, Stemming, TF-IDF), and Resampling was done before application of any of the Machine Learning algorithms used.

Methods Explored:
    Gaussian Naive Bayes
    Logistic Regression
    Decision Tree Classifier
    Adaboost Classifier
    Random Forest Classifier
